// Discriminated union of things a strategy can ask the edge to do.
//
// Two distinct shapes of edge consume these:
//
//  - Streaming edges (ACS bidirectional media WebSocket, browser SignalR audio):
//    handle Audio + StopPlayback. They reject SpeakText / PlayFile / CollectDtmf
//    because they have no platform to delegate to — the strategy must produce
//    raw PCM itself when paired with a streaming edge.
//
//  - Verb-based edges (ACS Call Automation REST without media WS):
//    handle SpeakText (TextSource via attached Cognitive Services), PlayFile
//    (FileSource), StopPlayback (CancelAllMediaOperations), and CollectDtmf
//    (StartRecognizing). They reject Audio because there's no place to write
//    bytes — ACS does the rendering.
//
// Strategies and edges are paired explicitly. We don't auto-synthesize on a
// streaming edge, and we don't try to encode PCM on a verb-based edge. If a
// strategy emits a directive its edge can't dispatch, the edge logs and drops
// it — surfaced via DispatchUnsupported in StrategyEvent.
